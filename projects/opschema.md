      # About


      It’s a powerfully simple idea.


      To improve the quality of our software development, we use continuous
      integration. To improve the reliability of our deployment, we use
      continuous delivery. To improve the security of our systems, we can use
      continuous authorization.


      Simply put, the tools that we use to develop and operate software, should
      also be used to generate and validate assessment and authorization
      packages.


      Every commit runs the tests. Every passing build, updates the system
      security plan. Every deployment includes updates to continuous monitoring.


      > Software as Code.


      > Tests as Code.


      > Infrastructure as Code.


      > Compliance as Code.




      ## It’s a set of tools and best practices.
